    <h3>Hello....</h3>
    <p>It's my pleasure to introduce my self..well, I'm Reinier Garcia.</p>
    <p>
      I am a Highly focused and reliable mid level Full-Stack Web Developer, with an excellent learning capacity and a
      high dedication to work. Competent in handling multiple tasks and concerns with the utmost professionalism.
      Able to work independently with little or no supervision, or in coordination with supervisors and other coworkers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Mid-level programmer with a good knowledge of front-end techniques and a complete passion about the
      back-end. I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details
      and optimizing web apps. I enjoy working in a team. As the saying goes: ‘two heads are better than one’.
