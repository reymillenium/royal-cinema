              <div style="text-align: justify;">
                Member of the Data & Interoperability Development Team (Data-IO). Improved and Optimized SQL performance
                and database access related to the EMR backend logic (complex modules like KipuLabs, Outcomes
                Measurement & Flags). Implemented and optimized Rspec tests on daily basis. Implemented & refactored
                Views structure and javascript behavior associated to those three modules.

              </div>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">
                Implemented the Flags Module inside the Medication Assisted Treatment Project. This module alerts the
                MAT staff with advanced reporting about certain conditions and pending actions, as well as to determine
                and suggest the processing on the patient queue automatically. It also provides a visual indicator to
                the user to address issues that need to be resolved with the patient, prior to dosing.

              <div style="text-align: justify;">
                Extended and optimized the Outcomes Measurement module with advanced reporting and configurable
                scheduler for different EMR locations. This tool integrates different assessment driven methodologies to
                determine the patient progress during treatment. The architecture is event-driven and combines an
                assessment scheduler, a delivery service, and features to evaluate, analyze and report the results.

                Perfected, expanded and maintained the already existing Kipu Labs Integration Project (KipuLabs Module).
                Updated the gems used in the implementation of a reactive communication protocol to exchange data
                between the EMR and the new Labs Platform service. Implemented the Medical Test Orders and the Potential
                Enrollments Report Sections, both with advanced reporting.
